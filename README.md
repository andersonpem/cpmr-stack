# The CPMR Stack

The complete, lightning fast, PHP stack for your project.

**Work in Progress**

## What's on this project?

- Caddy (v2) - A powerful lightning fast webserver with automatic HTTPS, HTTP/2, reverse proxy, load balancer and modern compression algorithms written in Go. If you want an A+ in your SSL-labs TLS test, this is the one for you :)

- PHP-FPM (7.4 out of the box)  - one of the best backends for PHP.

- MySQL (8 out of the box) - The latest version of Oracle's MySQL

- Redis - For stateless sessions, broadcasting, queues and much more
